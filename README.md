About this project

This is my first public web project under the brand ALTech Technology. It reflects both my growing programming skills and my identity as a digital artist. I created this platform to display my paintings, but also as a practical and elegant project for my programming portfolio.


# Portofoliu Galerie â€“ Django Web Application

This is a Django-based web application built to showcase my personal collection of paintings in a clean, modern and interactive way. The project is part of my journey to become a Full-Stack Developer, combining my passion for art with web development.
